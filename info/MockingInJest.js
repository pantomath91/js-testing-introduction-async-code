// Mock functions allow you to test the links between code by erasing the actual implementation of a function, capturing calls to the function (and the parameters passed in those calls), capturing instances of constructor functions when instantiated with new, and allowing test-time configuration of return values.
// There are two ways to mock functions: Either by creating a mock function to use in test code, or writing a manual mock to override a module dependency.
